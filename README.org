# XMONAD Configuration

I publish regularly my xmonad configuration
for some friends.

The main features are:

- no usage of a status bar
- support for modal editing like vim or i3,
  see for instance [[file:MusicMode.hs]]
  and [[file:ScreenshotMode.hs]]
  as a small example.
- mouse bindings are baked in, once I had to use a mouse
  and I configured it and this [[https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/xmonad/2010-July/010372.html][post]] was very helpful.
- Support for emacs-like chording doing bindings like
  #+begin_src haskell
  [ ("M4-c c", spawn "notify-send -a say EZ hello")
  , ("M4-c M4-s", screenshotMode)
  , ("M4-c M4-m", musicMode)
  ]
  #+end_src
  where =M4= is the windows modifier.


In terms of development, I have a workflow
of having an =env= directory
where all binaries enter that are created with
the =shell.nix= file.
Then emacs takes ahold of them through
=.dir-locals.el=.
